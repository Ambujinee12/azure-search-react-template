# Authentication

In many scenarios, you will want to add authentication to your application to limit who can use it. Fortunately, Azure Static Web Apps makes it really easy to [add authentication and authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/authentication-authorization) to the application.

This template is already configured to support authentication. However, it's worth noting that the application needs to be deployed to take advantage of this functionality.
